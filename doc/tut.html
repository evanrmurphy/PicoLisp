<h1>A PicoLisp Tutorial</h1>

<p align=right>(c) Software Lab. Alexander Burger

<h3>About this document</h3>

<p>This document demonstrates some aspects of the PicoLisp system in detail and
example. For a general description of the PicoLisp kernel please look at the <a
href="ref.html">PicoLisp Reference</a>.

<p>This is <i>not</i> a Lisp tutorial, as it assumes some basic knowledge of
programming, Lisp, and even PicoLisp. Please read these sections before coming
back here: <a href="ref.html#intro">Introduction</a> and <a
href="ref.html#vm">The PicoLisp Machine</a>. This tutorial concentrates on the
specificities of PicoLisp, and its differences with other Lisp dialects.

<h3>Now let's start</h3>

<p>If not stated otherwise, all examples assume that PicoLisp was started in the
installation directory from the shell prompt as

<pre><code>
$ ./dbg
:
</code></pre>

<p>It loads the PicoLisp base system and the debugging environment, and waits
for you to enter input lines at the interpreter prompt (<code>:</code>). You can
terminate the interpreter and return to the shell at any time, by either hitting
the ENTER key (i.e. by entering an empty line), or by executing the function
<code><a href="refB.html#bye">(bye)</a></code>.

<p>Please note that special handling is done during character input. This one
is incompatible with <code>rlwrap</code> for example but is more powerful.
<p><ul>
<li><code>vi</code>-like command-line editing (typos fixes and history with ESC,
<code>h</code>, <code>j</code>, <code>k</code> and <code>l</code> but not
arrows),</li>
<li>auto-formating (underlined) of double-quoted strings (don't try and struggle
to make <code>&quot;</code> appear).</li>
</ul>

<p>We notice that some people try to use Emacs - or some other IDE - as a
front-end to the PicoLisp console. This is not recommended, because the PicoLisp
debugging environment will set the console (tty) to raw mode by itself and do
the special handling seen above during character input.

<p>If you feel that you absolutely have to use an IDE, <code>rlwrap</code> or
another input front-end, please remove the entry "@lib/led.l" from "dbg.l".
Note that in this case, however, you will not have the TAB symbol completion
feature available during command line editing.

<h3>Table of content</h3>

<h2><a name="ledit">Command Line Editing</a></h2>

<p>PicoLisp permanently reads input from the current input channel (i.e. the
console in interactive mode), evaluates it, and prints the result to the current
output channel. This is called a "read-eval-print-loop" (REPL).

<h3>VI-like edition</h3>

<p>It is very helpful - though not absolutely necessary - when you know how to
use the <code>vi</code> editor.

<p>To alleviate the task of manual line input, a command line editor is provided
which is similar to (though much simpler than) the <code>readline</code> feature
of the <code>bash</code> shell. Only a subset of the <code>vi</code> mode is
supported, which is restricted to single-key commands (the "real"
<code>vi</code> supports multi-key commands and the modification of most
commands with count prefixes). It is loaded at startup via "dbg.l", you find its
source in "lib/led.l".

<p>You can enter lines in the normal way, correcting mistypes with the BACKSPACE
key, and terminating them with the ENTER key. This is the <i>Insert Mode</i>.

<p>If you hit ESC, you get into <i>Command Mode</i>. Now you can navigate
horizontally in the current input line, or vertically in the history of
previously entered lines, with key commands borrowed from the <code>vi</code>
editor (only <code>h</code>, <code>j</code>, <code>k</code> and <code>l</code>
and not arrows). Note, however, that there is always only a single line visible.

<p>Let's say you did some calculation

<pre><code>
: (* (+ 2 3) (- 7 2))
-> 25
:
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to repeat a modified version of this command, using
<code>8</code> instead of <code>7</code>, you don't have to re-type the
whole command, but type

<p><ul>
<li>ESC to get into <i>Command Mode</i>
<li><code>k</code> to get one line "up"
<li><code>f</code> and <code>7</code> to "find" the character <code>7</code>
<li><code>r</code> and <code>8</code> to "replace" with <code>8</code>
</ul>

<p>Then you hit ENTER to execute the modified line. Instead of jumping to the
<code>7</code> with the "find" command, you may also type <code>l</code> (move
"right") repeatedly till you reach the correct position.

<p>The key commands in the <i>Command Mode</i> are listed below. Some commands
change the mode back to <i>Insert Mode</i> as indicated in parentheses. Commands
which operate on a "word" take either the current atom (number or symbol), or a
whole expression when the cursor is at a left parenthesis.

<p><ul>
<li><code>k</code> - Go up one line
<li><code>j</code> - Go down one line
<li><code>l</code> - Go right one character
<li><code>h</code> - Go left one character
<li><code>w</code> - Go right one word
<li><code>b</code> - Go back (left) one word
<li><code>0</code> - Go to the beginning of the line
<li><code>$</code> - Go to the end of the line
<li><code>i</code> - Enter <i>Insert Mode</i> at the cursor position
<li><code>a</code> - Append (<i>Insert Mode</i>) after the cursor position
<li><code>A</code> - Append (<i>Insert Mode</i>) at the end of the line
<li><code>I</code> - Insert (<i>Insert Mode</i>) at the beginning of the line
<li><code>x</code> - Delete the character at the cursor position
<li><code>X</code> - Delete the character left of the cursor position
<li><code>r</code> - Replace the character at the cursor position with the next key
<li><code>s</code> - Substitute the character at the cursor position (<i>Insert Mode</i>)
<li><code>S</code> - Substitute the whole line (<i>Insert Mode</i>)
<li><code>d</code> - Delete the word at the cursor position (<i>Insert Mode</i>)
<li><code>D</code> - Delete the rest of the line
<li><code>c</code> - Change the word at the cursor position (<i>Insert Mode</i>)
<li><code>C</code> - Change the rest of the line (<i>Insert Mode</i>)
<li><code>f</code> - Find next key in the rest of the current line
<li><code>p</code> - Paste data deleted with <code>x</code>, <code>X</code>, <code>d</code> or <code>D</code> after the cursor position
<li><code>P</code> - Paste data deleted with <code>x</code>, <code>X</code>, <code>d</code> or <code>D</code> before the cursor position
<li><code>/</code> - Accept an input pattern and search the history for it
<li><code>n</code> - Search for next occurrence of pattern (as entered with <code>/</code>)
<li><code>N</code> - Search for previous occurrence of pattern
<li><code>%</code> - Go to matching parenthesis
<li><code>~</code> - Convert character to opposite (lower or upper) case and move right
<li><code>u</code> - Undo the last change (one level only)
<li><code>U</code> - Undo all changes of the current line
<li><code>g</code> - Display current contents of cut buffer (not in <code>vi</code>)
</ul>

<p>Notes:
<ul>

<li>The <code>d</code> command corresponds to the <code>dw</code> command of the
<code>vi</code> editor, and <code>c</code> corresponds to <code>cw</code>.

<li>Search patterns may contain "<code>@</code>" characters as wildcards.

<li>Lines shorter than 3 characters, lines beginning with a space character, or
duplicate lines are not entered into the history.

<li>The history is stored in a file named ".picoHistory" in the PicoLisp home
directory. The length of the history is limited to 1000 lines.

</ul>

<p>The following two key-combinations work both in Insert and Command Mode:

<p><ul>

<li><code>Ctrl-D</code> will immediately terminate the current process, and also
all of its sister processes (i.e. children of the same parent process, typically
an application server during debugging).

<li><code>Ctrl-X</code> discards all input, abandons further processing, and
returns to the interpreter's top level (equivalent to invoking <code><a
href="refQ.html#quit">quit</a></code>). This is also useful when the program
stopped at a breakpoint (see single-stepping <a href="#dbg">Debugging</a>), or
after program execution was interrupted with <code>Ctrl-C</code>.

</ul>

<p>Besides these two keys, in <i>Insert Mode</i> only the following keys have a
special meaning:

<p><ul>

<li>BACKSPACE (<code>Ctrl-H</code>) and DEL erase the character to the left

<li><code>Ctrl-V</code> inserts the next key literally

<li>TAB performs symbol and/or path completion: When a symbol (or path) name is
entered partially and TAB is pressed subsequently, all internal symbols (and/or
path names in the file system) matching the partial input are shown in sequence.

<li>ESC terminates <i>Input Mode</i> and enters <i>Command Mode</i>

</ul>

<h3>Behaviour of double-quoted strings</h3>

Don't try to display &quot; in the REPL, it may be removed and the string you
wanted to quote will be underlined. Just close with another &quot; keystroke.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Please take some time to experiment and to get used to command line editing.
It will make life much easier in the future :-)


<p><hr>
<h2><a name="brw">Browsing</a></h2>

<p>PicoLisp provides some functionality for inspecting pieces of data and code
within the running system.

<h3>Basic tools</h3>

The really basic tools are of course available and their name alone is enough
to know:
<code><a href="refP.html#print">print</a></code>,
<code><a href="refS.html#size">size</a></code>
...

<p>But you will appreciate some more powerful tools like:
<p><ul><li><code><a href="refM.html#match">match</a></code>, a predicate which
    compares S-expressions with bindable wildcards when matching,</li>
</ul>

<h3>Inspect a symbol with <i>show</i></h3>

<p>The most commonly used tool is probably the <code><a
href="refS.html#show">show</a></code> function. It takes a symbolic argument,
and shows the symbol's name (if any), followed by its value cell, and then the
contents of the property list on the following lines (assignment of such things
to a symbol can be done with <code><a href="refS.html#set">set</a></code>,
<code><a href="refS.html#setq">setq</a></code>, and <code><a
href="refP.html#put">put</a></code>).

<pre><code>
: (setq A '(This is the value))  # Set the value cell of 'A'
-> (This is the value)
: (put 'A 'key1 'val1)           # Store property 'key1'
-> val1
: (put 'A 'key2 'val2)           # and 'key2'
-> val2
: (show 'A)                      # Now 'show' the symbol 'A'
A (This is the value)
   key2 val2
   key1 val1
-> A
</code></pre>

<p><code>show</code> accepts an arbitrary number of arguments which are
processed according to the rules of <code><a
href="refG.html#get">get</a></code>, resulting in a symbol which is showed then.

<pre><code>
: (put 'B 'a 'A)        # Put 'A' under the 'a'-property of 'B'
-> A
: (setq Lst '(A B C))   # Create a list with 'B' as second argument
-> (A B C)
: (show Lst 2 'a)       # Show the property 'a of the 2nd element of 'Lst'
A (This is the value)   # (which is 'A' again)
   key2 val2
   key1 val1
-> A
</code></pre>

<h3>Inspect and edit with <i>edit</i></h3>

<p>Similar to <code>show</code> is <code><a
href="refE.html#edit">edit</a></code>. It takes an arbitrary number of symbolic
arguments, writes them to a temporary file in a format similar to
<code>show</code>, and starts the <code>vim</code> editor with that file.

<pre><code>
: (edit 'A 'B)
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>vim</code> window will look like

<pre><code>
A (This is the value)
key1 val1
key2 val2

(********)

B NIL
a A  # (This is the value)

(********)
</code></pre>

<p>Now you can modify values or properties. You should not touch the
parenthesized asterisks, as they serve as delimiters. If you position the cursor
on the first character of a symbol name and type '<code>K</code>' ("Keyword
lookup"), the editor will be restarted with that symbol added to the editor
window. '<code>Q</code>' (for "Quit") will bring you back to the previous view.

<p><code>edit</code> is also very useful to browse in a database. You can follow
the links between objects with '<code>K</code>', and even - e.g. for low-level
repairs - modify the data (but only if you are really sure about what you are
doing, and don't forget to <code><a href="refC.html#commit">commit</a></code>
when you are done).

<h3>Built-in pretty print with <i>pp</i></h3>

<p>The <i>pretty-print</i> function <code><a href="refP.html#pp">pp</a></code>
takes a symbol that has a function defined (or two symbols that specify message
and class for a method definition), and displays that definition in a formatted
and indented way.

<pre><code>
: (pp 'pretty)
(de pretty (X N . @)
   (setq N (abs (space (or N 0))))
   (while (args)
      (printsp (next)) )
   (if (or (atom X) (>= 12 (size X)))
      (print X)
      (while (== 'quote (car X))
         (prin "'")
         (pop 'X) )
      (let Z X
         (prin "(")
         (when (memq (print (pop 'X)) *PP)
            (cond
               ((memq (car Z) *PP1)
                  (if (and (pair (car X)) (pair (cdar X)))
                     (when (>= 12 (size (car X)))
                        (space)
                        (print (pop 'X)) )
                     (space)
                     (print (pop 'X))
                     (when (or (atom (car X)) (>= 12 (size (car X))))
                        (space)
                        (print (pop 'X)) ) ) )
               ((memq (car Z) *PP2)
                  (inc 'N 3)
                  (loop
                     (prinl)
                     (pretty (cadr X) N (car X))
                     (NIL (setq X (cddr X)) (space)) ) )
               ((or (atom (car X)) (>= 12 (size (car X))))
                  (space)
                  (print (pop 'X)) ) ) )
         (when X
            (loop
               (T (== Z X) (prin " ."))
               (T (atom X) (prin " . ") (print X))
               (prinl)
               (pretty (pop 'X) (+ 3 N))
               (NIL X) )
            (space) )
         (prin ")") ) ) )
-> pretty
</code></pre>

<p>The style is the same as we use in source files:

<ul>

<li>The indentation level is three spaces

<li>If a list is too long (to be precise: if its <code><a
href="refS.html#size">size</a></code> is greater than 12), pretty-print the CAR
on the current line, and each element of the CDR recursively on its own line.

<li>A closing parenthesis a preceded by a space if the corresponding open
parenthesis is not on the same line

</ul>

<h3>Inspect elements one by one with <i>more</i></h3>

<p><code><a href="refM.html#more">more</a></code> is a simple tool that displays
the elements of a list one by one. It stops after each element and waits for
input. If you just hit ENTER, <code>more</code> continues with the next element,
otherwise (usually I type a dot (<code>.</code>) followed by ENTER) it
terminates.

<pre><code>
: (more (1 2 3 4 5 6))
1                          # Hit ENTER
2.                         # Hit '.' and ENTER
-> T                       # stopped
</code></pre>

<p>Optionally <code>more</code> takes a function as a second argument and
applies that function to each element (instead of the default <code><a
href="refP.html#print">print</a></code>). Here, often <code>show</code> or
<code>pp</code> (see below) is used.

<pre><code>
: (more '(A B))            # Step through 'A' and 'B'
A
B
-> NIL
: (more '(A B) show)       # Step through 'A' and 'B' with 'show'
A (This is the value)      # showing 'A'
   key2 val2
   key1 val1
                           # Hit ENTER
B NIL                      # showing 'B'
   a A
-> NIL
</code></pre>

<h3>Search through available symbols with <i>what</i></h3>

<p>The <code><a href="refW.html#what">what</a></code> function returns a list of
all internal symbols in the system which match a given pattern (with
'<code>@</code>' wildcard characters).

<pre><code>
: (what "prin@")
-> (prin print prinl print> printsp println)
</code></pre>

<h3>Search through values or properties of symbols with <i>who</i></h3>

<p>The function <code><a href="refW.html#who">who</a></code> returns <i>"who
contains that"</i>, i.e. a list of symbols that contain a given argument
somewhere in their value or property list.

<pre><code>
: (who 'print)
-> ((print> . +relation) query show select pretty "edit" msg rules pp more
(print> . +Date)) </code></pre>

<p>A dotted pair indicates either a method definition or a property entry. So
<code>(print> . +relation)</code> denotes the <code>print&gt;</code> method of
the <code><a href="refR.html#+relation">+relation</a></code> class.

<p><code>who</code> can be conveniently combined with <code>more</code> and
<code>pp</code>:

<pre><code>
: (more (who 'print) pp)
(dm (print> . +relation) (Val)   # Pretty-print these functions one by one
   (print Val) )

(de query ("Q" "Dbg")
   ...
</code></pre>

<p>The argument to <code>who</code> may also be a pattern list (see <code><a
href="refM.html#match">match</a></code>):

<pre><code>
: (who '(print @ (val @)))
-> (show)

: (more (who '(% @ 7)) pp)
(de day (Dat Lst)
   (get
      (or Lst *DayFmt)
      (inc (% (inc Dat) 7)) ) )

(de _week (Dat)
   (/ (- Dat (% (inc Dat) 7)) 7) )
</code></pre>

<h3>Find what classes can accept a given message with <i>can</i></h3>

<p>The function <code><a href="refC.html#can">can</a></code> returns a list
which indicates which classes <i>can</i> accept a given message. Again, this
list is suitable for iteration with <code>pp</code>:

<pre><code>
: (can 'del>)                                   # Which classes accept 'del>' ?
-> ((del> . +relation) (del> . +Entity) (del> . +List))
: (more (can 'del>) pp)                         # Inspect the methods with 'pp'
(dm (del> . +relation) (Obj Old Val)
   (and (&lt;> Old Val) Val) )

(dm (del> . +Entity) (Var Val)
   (when
      (and
         Val
         (has> (meta This Var) Val (get This Var)) )
      (let Old (get This Var)
         (rel>
            (meta This Var)
            This
            Old
            (put This Var (del> (meta This Var) This Old @)) )
         (upd> This Var Old) ) ) )

(dm (del> . +List) (Obj Old Val)
   (and (&lt;> Old Val) (delete Val Old)) )
</code></pre>

<h3>Inspect dependencies with <i>dep</i></h3>

<p><code><a href="refD.html#dep">dep</a></code> shows the dependencies in a
class hierarchy. That is, for a given class it displays the tree of its
(super)class(es) above it, and the tree of its subclasses below it.

<p>To view the complete hierarchy of input fields, we start with the root class
<code><a href="refR.html#+relation">+relation</a></code>:

<pre><code>
: (dep '+relation)
+relation
   +Number
      +Time
      +Date
   +Symbol
      +String
   +Blob
   +Link
      +Joint
   +Bool
   +Any
   +Bag
-> +relation
</code></pre>

<p>If we are interested in <code>+Link</code>:

<pre><code>
: (dep '+Link)
   +relation
+Link
   +Joint
-> +Link
</code></pre>

<p>This says that <code>+Link</code> is a subclass of <code><a
href="refR.html#+relation">+relation</a></code>, and has a single subclass
(<code>+Joint</code>).


<p><hr>
<h2><a name="fun">Defining Functions</a></h2>

<p>Most of the time during programming is spent defining functions (or methods).
In the following we will concentrate on functions, but most will be true for
methods as well except for using <code><a href="refD.html#dm">dm</a></code>
instead of <code><a href="refD.html#de">de</a></code>.

<h3>Functions with no argument</h3>

<p>The notorious "Hello world" function must be defined:

<pre><code>
: (de hello ()
   (prinl "Hello world") )
-> hello
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>()</code> in the first line indicates a function without arguments.
The body of the function is in the second line, consisting of a single
statement. The last line is the return value of <code>de</code>, which here is
the defined symbol. From now on we will omit the return values of examples when
they are unimportant.

<p>Now you can call this function this way:

<pre><code>
: (hello)
Hello world
</code></pre>

<h3>Functions with one argument</h3>

<p>A function with an argument might be defined this way:

<pre><code>
: (de hello (X)
   (prinl "Hello " X) )
# hello redefined
</code></pre>

<p>PicoLisp informs you that you have just redefined the function. This might be
a useful warning in case you forgot that a bound symbol with that name already
existed.

<pre><code>
: (hello "world")
Hello world
</code></pre>

<pre><code>
: (hello "Alex")
Hello Alex
</code></pre>

<h3>Preventing arguments evaluation and variable number of arguments</h3>

<p>Normally, PicoLisp evaluates the arguments before it passes them to a
function:

<pre><code>
: (hello (+ 1 2 3))
Hello 6
</code></pre>

<pre><code>
: (setq A 1  B 2)       # Set 'A' to 1 and 'B' to 2
-> 2
: (de foo (X Y)         # 'foo' returns the list of its arguments
   (list X Y) )
-> foo
: (foo A B)             # Now call 'foo' with 'A' and 'B'
-> (1 2)                # -> We get a list of 1 and 2, the values of 'A' and 'B'
</code></pre>

<p>In some cases you don't want that. For some functions (<code><a
href="refS.html#setq">setq</a></code> for example) it is better if the function
gets all arguments unevaluated, and can decide for itself what to do with them.

<p>For such cases you do not define the function with a <i>list</i> of
parameters, but give it a <i>single atomic</i> parameter instead. PicoLisp will
then bind all (unevaluated) arguments as a list to that parameter.

<pre><code>
: (de foo X
   (list (car X) (cadr X)) )        # 'foo' lists the first two arguments

: (foo A B)                         # Now call it again
-> (A B)                            # -> We don't get '(1 2)', but '(A B)'

: (de foo X
   (list (car X) (eval (cadr X))) ) # Now evaluate only the second argument

: (foo A B)
-> (A 2)                            # -> We get '(A 2)'
</code></pre>

<h3>Mixing evaluated arguments and variable number of unevaluated arguments</h3>

<p>As a logical consequence, you can combine these principles. To define a
function with 2 evaluated and an arbitrary number of unevaluated arguments:

<pre><code>
: (de foo (X Y . Z)     # Evaluate only the first two args
   (list X Y Z) )

: (foo A B C D E)
-> (1 2 (C D E))        # -> Get the value of 'A' and 'B' and the remaining list
</code></pre>

<h3>Variable number of evaluated arguments</h3>

<p>More common, in fact, is the case where you want to pass an arbitrary number
of <i>evaluated</i> arguments to a function. For that, PicoLisp recognizes the
symbol <code>@</code> as a single atomic parameter and remembers all evaluated
arguments in an internal frame. This frame can then be accessed sequentially
with the <code><a href="refA.html#args">args</a></code>, <code><a
href="refN.html#next">next</a></code>, <code><a
href="refA.html#arg">arg</a></code> and <code><a
href="refR.html#rest">rest</a></code> functions.

<pre><code>
: (de foo @
   (list (next) (next)) )     # Get the first two arguments

: (foo A B)
-> (1 2)
</code></pre>

<p>Again, this can be combined:

<pre><code>
: (de foo (X Y . @)
   (list X Y (next) (next)) ) # 'X' and 'Y' are fixed arguments

: (foo A B (+ 3 4) (* 3 4))
-> (1 2 7 12)                 # All arguments are evaluated
</code></pre>

<p>These examples are not very useful, because the advantage of a variable
number of arguments is not used. A function that prints all its evaluated
numeric arguments, each on a line followed by its squared value:

<pre><code>
: (de foo @
   (while (args)                            # Check if there are some args left
      (println (next) (* (arg) (arg))) ) )  # Call the last arg (next) returned

: (foo (+ 2 3) (- 7 1) 1234 (* 9 9))
5 25
6 36
1234 1522756
81 6561
-> 6561
</code></pre>

<p>This next example shows the behaviour of <code>args</code> and
<code>rest</code>:

<pre><code>
: (de foo @
   (while (args)
      (next)
      (println (arg) (args) (rest)) ) )
: (foo 1 2 3)
1 T (2 3)
2 T (3)
3 NIL NIL
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, it is possible to pass all these evaluated arguments to another
function, using <code><a href="refP.html#pass">pass</a></code>:

<pre><code>
: (de foo @
   (pass println 9 8 7)       # First print all arguments preceded by 9, 8, 7
   (pass + 9 8 7) )           # Then add all these values

: (foo (+ 2 3) (- 7 1) 1234 (* 9 9))
9 8 7 5 6 1234 81             # Printing ...
-> 1350                       # Return the result
</code></pre>

<h3>Anonymous functions without the <i>lambda</i> keyword</h3>

There's no distinction between code and data in PicoLisp,
<code><a href="refQ.html#quote">quote</a></code> will do what you want (see
also <a href="faq.html#lambda">this FAQ entry</a>).

<pre><code>
: ((quote (X) (* X X)) 9)
-> 81
</code></pre>

<pre><code>
: (setq f '((X) (* X X)))
-> ((X) (* X X))
: f
-> ((X) (* X X))
: (f 3)
-> 9
</code></pre>

<h2><a name="dbg">Debugging</a></h2>

<p>There are two major ways to debug functions (and methods) at runtime:
<i>Tracing</i> and <i>single-stepping</i>.

In this section we will use the REPL to explore the debugging facilities, but in
the <a href="#script">Scripting</a> section, you will learn how to launch
PicoLisp scripts with some selected functions debugged:

<pre><code>
$ ./dbg app/file1.l -"trace 'foo" -main -"debug 'bar" app/file2.l
</code></pre>

<h3>Tracing</h3>

<p><i>Tracing</i> means letting functions of interest print their name and arguments
when they are entered, and their name again and the return value when they are
exited.

<p>For demonstration, let's define the unavoidable factorial function (or just
<code><a href="refL.html#load">load</a></code> the file "<code><a
href="fun.l">doc/fun.l</a></code>"):

<pre><code>
(de fact (N)
   (if (=0 N)
      1
      (* N (fact (dec N))) ) )
</code></pre>

<p>With <code><a href="refT.html#trace">trace</a></code> we can put it in trace
mode:

<pre><code>
: (trace 'fact)
-> fact
</code></pre>

<p>Calling <code>fact</code> now will display its execution trace.

<pre><code>
: (fact 3)
 fact : 3
  fact : 2
   fact : 1
    fact : 0
    fact = 1
   fact = 1
  fact = 2
 fact = 6
-> 6
</code></pre>

<p>As can be seen here, each level of function call will indent by an additional
space. Upon function entry, the name is separated from the arguments with a
colon (<code>:</code>), and upon function exit with an equals sign
(<code>=</code>) from the return value.

<p><code>trace</code> works by modifying the function body, so generally it
works only for functions defined as lists (lambda expressions, see <a
href="ref.html#ev">Evaluation</a>). Tracing a C-function is possible, however,
when it is a function that evaluates all its arguments.

<p>So let's trace the functions <code><a href="ref_.html#=0">=0</a></code> and
<code><a href="ref_.html#*">*</a></code>:

<pre><code>
: (trace '=0)
-> =0
: (trace '*)
-> *
</code></pre>

<p>If we call <code>fact</code> again, we see the additional output:

<pre><code>
: (fact 3)
 fact : 3
  =0 : 3
  =0 = NIL
  fact : 2
   =0 : 2
   =0 = NIL
   fact : 1
    =0 : 1
    =0 = NIL
    fact : 0
     =0 : 0
     =0 = 0
    fact = 1
    * : 1 1
    * = 1
   fact = 1
   * : 2 1
   * = 2
  fact = 2
  * : 3 2
  * = 6
 fact = 6
-> 6
</code></pre>

<p>To reset a function to its untraced state, call <code><a
href="refU.html#untrace">untrace</a></code>:

<pre><code>
: (untrace 'fact)
-> fact
: (untrace '=0)
-> =0
: (untrace '*)
-> *
</code></pre>

<p>or simply use <code><a href="refM.html#mapc">mapc</a></code>:

<pre><code>
: (mapc untrace '(fact =0 *))
-> *
</code></pre>

<h3>Single-stepping</h3>

<p><i>Single-stepping</i> means to execute a function step by step, giving the
programmer an opportunity to look more closely at what is happening. The
function <code><a href="refD.html#debug">debug</a></code> inserts a breakpoint
into each top-level expression of a function. When the function is called, it
stops at each breakpoint, displays the expression it is about to execute next
(this expression is also stored into the global variable <code><a
href="ref_.html#^">^</a></code>) and enters a read-eval-loop. The programmer can
then

<ul>

<li>inspect the current environment by typing variable names or calling
functions

<li>execute <code>(<a href="refD.html#d">d</a>)</code> to recursively debug the
next expression (looping through subexpressions of this expression)

<li>execute <code>(<a href="refE.html#e">e</a>)</code> to evaluate the next
expression, to see what will happen without actually advancing on

<li>type ENTER (that is, enter an empty line) to leave the read-eval loop and
continue with the next expression

</ul>

<p>Thus, in the simplest case, single-stepping consists of just hitting ENTER
repeatedly to step through the function.

<p>To try it out, let's look at the <code><a
href="refS.html#stamp">stamp</a></code> system function. You may need to have a
look at

<ul>
<li><code><a href="ref_.html#=T">=T</a></code> (T test),</li>

<li><code><a href="refD.html#date">date</a></code> and <code><a
href="refT.html#time">time</a></code> (grab system date and time)

<li><code><a href="refD.html#default">default</a></code> (conditional
assignments)

<li><code><a href="refP.html#pack">pack</a></code> (kind of concatenation), and

<li><code><a href="refD.html#dat$">dat$</a></code> and <code><a
href="refT.html#tim$">tim$</a></code> (date and time formats)</li>

</ul>

to understand this definition.

<pre><code>
: (pp 'stamp)
(de stamp (Dat Tim)
   (and (=T Dat) (setq Dat (date T)))
   (default Dat (date) Tim (time T))
   (pack (dat$ Dat "-") " " (tim$ Tim T)) )
-> stamp
</code></pre>

<pre><code>
: (debug 'stamp)                       # Debug it
-> T
: (stamp)                              # Call it again
(and (=T Dat) (setq Dat (date T)))     # stopped at first expression
!                                      # ENTER
(default Dat (date) Tim (time T))      # second expression
!                                      # ENTER
(pack (dat$ Dat "-") " " (tim$ ...     # third expression
! Tim                                  # inspect 'Tim' variable
-> 41908
! (time Tim)                           # convert it
-> (11 38 28)
!                                      # ENTER
-> "2004-10-29 11:38:28"               # done, as there are only 3 expressions
</code></pre>

<p>Now we execute it again, but this time we want to look at what's happening
inside the second expression.

<pre><code>
: (stamp)                              # Call it again
(and (=T Dat) (setq Dat (date T)))
!                                      # ENTER
(default Dat (date) Tim (time T))
!                                      # ENTER
(pack (dat$ Dat "-") " " (tim$ ...     # here we want to look closer
! (d)                                  # debug this expression
-> T
!                                      # ENTER
(dat$ Dat "-")                         # stopped at first subexpression
! (e)                                  # evaluate it
-> "2004-10-29"
!                                      # ENTER
(tim$ Tim T)                           # stopped at second subexpression
! (e)                                  # evaluate it
-> "11:40:44"
!                                      # ENTER
-> "2004-10-29 11:40:44"               # done
</code></pre>

<p>The breakpoints still remain in the function body. We can see them when we
pretty-print it:

<pre><code>
: (pp 'stamp)
(de stamp (Dat Tim)
   (! and (=T Dat) (setq Dat (date T)))
   (! default Dat (date) Tim (time T))
   (! pack
      (! dat$ Dat "-")
      " "
      (! tim$ Tim T) ) )
-> stamp
</code></pre>

<p>To reset the function to its normal state, call <code><a
href="refU.html#unbug">unbug</a></code>:

<pre><code>
: (unbug 'stamp)
</code></pre>

<p>Often, you will not want to single-step a whole function. Just use
<code>edit</code> (see above) to insert a single breakpoint (the exclamation
mark followed by a space) as CAR of an expression, and run your program.
Execution will then stop there as described above; you can inspect the
environment and continue execution with ENTER when you are done.

<h2><a name="funio">Functional I/O</a></h2>

<p>Input and output in PicoLisp is functional, in the sense that there are not
variables assigned to file descriptors, which need then to be passed to I/O
functions for reading, writing and closing. Instead, these functions operate on
implicit input and output channels, which are created and maintained as dynamic
environments.

<p>Standard input and standard output are the default channels. Try reading a
single expression:

<pre><code>
: (read)
(a b c)        # Console input
-> (a b c)
</code></pre>

<p>To read from a file, we redirect the input with <code><a
href="refI.html#in">in</a></code>. Note that comments and white space are
automatically skipped by <code>read</code>:

<pre><code>
: (in "doc/fun.l" (read))
-> (de fact (N) (if (=0 N) 1 (* N (fact (dec N)))))
</code></pre>

<p>The <code><a href="refS.html#skip">skip</a></code> function can also be used
directly. To get the first non-white character in the file with <code><a
href="refC.html#char">char</a></code>:

<pre><code>
: (in "doc/fun.l" (skip "#") (char))
-> "("
</code></pre>

<p><code><a href="refF.html#from">from</a></code> searches through the input
stream for given patterns. Typically, this is not done with Lisp source files
(there are better ways), but for a simple example let's extract all items
immediately following <code>fact</code> in the file,

<pre><code>
: (in "doc/fun.l" (while (from "fact ") (println (read))))
(N)
(dec N)
</code></pre>

<p>or the word following "(de " with <code><a
href="refT.html#till">till</a></code>:

<pre><code>
: (in "doc/fun.l" (from "(de ") (till " " T)))
-> "fact"
</code></pre>


<p>With <code><a href="refL.html#line">line</a></code>, a line of characters is
read, either into a single <a href="ref.html#transient-io">transient</a> symbol
(the type used by PicoLisp for strings),

<pre><code>
: (in "doc/tut.html" (line T))
-> "&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://..."
</code></pre>

<p>or into a list of symbols (characters):

<pre><code>
: (in "doc/tut.html" (line))
-> ("&lt;" "!" "D" "O" "C" "T" "Y" "P" "E" " " "H" "T" "M" "L" ...
</code></pre>

<p><code>line</code> is typically used to read tabular data from a file.
Additional arguments can split the line into fixed-width fields, as described in
the <code><a href="refL.html#line">reference manual</a></code>. If, however, the
data are of variable width, delimited by some special character, the <code><a
href="refS.html#split">split</a></code> function can be used to extract the
fields. A typical way to import the contents of such a file is:

<pre><code>
(load "lib/import.l")

(in '("bin/utf2" "importFile.txt")              # Pipe: Convert to UTF-8
   (until (eof)                                 # Process whole file
      (let L (split (line) "^I")                # TAB-delimited data
         ... use 'getStr', 'getNum' etc ...     # process them
</code></pre>

<p>Some more examples with <code><a href="refE.html#echo">echo</a></code>:

<pre><code>
(in "a"                                         # Copy the first 40 Bytes
   (out "b"                                     # from file "a" to file "b"
      (echo 40) ) )

(in "doc/tut.html"                              # Show the HTTP-header
   (line)
   (echo "&lt;body>") )

(out "file.mac"                                 # Convert to Macintosh
   (in "file.txt"                               # from Unix or DOS format:
      (while (char)
         (prin
            (case @
               ("^M" NIL)                       # ignore CR
               ("^J" "^M")                      # convert CR to LF
               (T @) ) ) ) ) )                  # otherwise no change

(out "c"                                        # Merge the contents of "a"
   (in "b"                                      # and "b" into "c"
      (in "a"
         (while (read)                          # Read an item from "a",
            (println @ (in -1 (read))) ) ) ) )  # print it with an item from "b"
</code></pre>


<p><hr>
<h2><a name="script">Scripting</a></h2>

<p>There are two possibilities to get the PicoLisp interpreter into doing useful
work: via command line arguments, or as a stand-alone script.

<h3>Command line arguments for the PicoLisp interpreter</h3>

<p>The command line can specify either files for execution, or arbitrary Lisp
expressions for direct evaluation (see <code><a
href="ref.html#invoc">Invocation</a></code>): if an argument starts with a
hyphen, it is evaluated, otherwise it is <code><a
href="refL.html#load">load</a></code>ed as a file. A typical invocation might
look like:

<pre><code>
$ ./dbg app/file1.l -main app/file2.l
</code></pre>

<p>It loads the debugging environment, an application source file, calls the
main function, and then loads another application source. In a typical
development and debugging session, this line is often modified using the shell's
history mechanisms, e.g. by inserting debugging statements:

<pre><code>
$ ./dbg app/file1.l -"trace 'foo" -main -"debug 'bar" app/file2.l
</code></pre>

<p>Another convenience during debugging and testing is to put things into the
command line (shell history) which would otherwise have to be done each time in
the application's user interface:

<pre><code>
$ ./dbg app/file1.l -main app/file2.l -go -'login "name" "password"'
</code></pre>

<p>The final production release of an application usually includes a shell
script, which initializes the environment, does some bookkeeping and cleanup,
and calls the application with a proper command line. It is no problem if the
command line is long and complicated.

<p>For small utility programs, however, this is overkill. Enter full PicoLisp
scripts.

<h3>PicoLisp scripts</h3>

It is better to write
a single executable file using the mechanisms of "interpreter files". If the
first two characters in an executable file are "<code>#!</code>", the operating
system kernel will pass this file to an interpreter program whose pathname is
given in the first line (optionally followed by a single argument). This is fast
and efficient, because the overhead of a subshell is avoided.

<p>Let's assume you installed PicoLisp in the directory "/home/foo/picolisp/",
and put links to the executable and the installation directory as:

<pre><code>
$ ln -s /home/foo/picolisp /usr/lib/picolisp
$ ln -s /usr/lib/picolisp/bin/picolisp /usr/bin/picolisp
</code></pre>

Then a simple hello-world script might look like:

<pre><code>
#!/usr/bin/picolisp /usr/lib/picolisp/lib.l
(prinl "Hello world!")
(bye)
</code></pre>

<p>If you write this into a text file, and use <code>chmod</code> to set it to
"executable", it can be executed like any other command. Note that (because
<code>#</code> is the comment character in PicoLisp) the first line will not be
interpreted, and you can still use that file as a normal command line argument
to PicoLisp (useful during debugging).

<h3>Grab command line arguments from PicoLisp scripts</h3>

<p>The fact that a hyphen causes evaluation of command line arguments can be
used to simulate something like command line options. The following script
defines two functions <code>a</code> and <code>f</code>, and then calls
<code>(<a href="refL.html#load">load</a> T)</code> to process the rest of the
command line (which otherwise would be ignored because of the <code>(<a
href="refB.html#bye">bye</a>)</code> statement):

<pre><code>
#!/usr/bin/picolisp /usr/lib/picolisp/lib.l

(de a ()
   (println '-a '-> (opt)) )

(de f ()
   (println '-f '-> (opt)) )

(load T)
(bye)
</code></pre>

(<code><a href="refO.html#opt">opt</a></code> retrieves the next command line
option)

<p>Calling this script (let's say we named it "testOpts") gives:

<pre><code>
$ ./testOpts -f abc
-f -> "abc"
$ ./testOpts -a xxx  -f yyy
-a -> "xxx"
-f -> "yyy"
</code></pre>

<p>We have to be aware of the fact, however, that the aggregation of arguments
like

<pre><code>
$ ./testOpts -axxx  -fyyy
</code></pre>

<p>or

<pre><code>
$ ./testOpts -af yyy
</code></pre>

<p>cannot be achieved with this simple and general mechanism of command line
processing.

<h3>Run scripts from arbitrary places on the host file system</h3>

<p>Utilities are typically used outside the context of the PicoLisp environment.
All examples above assumed that the current working directory is the PicoLisp
installation directory, which is usually all right for applications developed in
that environment. Command line file arguments like "dbg.l" or "app/file1.l" will
be properly found.

<p>To allow utilities to run in arbitrary places on the host file system, the
concept of <i>home directory substitution</i> was introduced. The interpreter
remembers internally at start-up the pathname of its first argument (usually
"lib.l"), and substitutes any leading "<code>@</code>" character in subsequent
file names with that pathname. Thus, to run the above example in some other
place, simply write:

<pre><code>
$ /home/foo/picolisp/dbg @app/file1.l -main @app/file2.l
</code></pre>

<p>that is, supply a full path name to the initial command (here 'p'), or put it
into your <code>PATH</code> variable, and prefix each file which has to be
loaded from the PicoLisp home directory with a <code>@</code> character.
"Normal" files (not prefixed by <code>@</code>) will be opened or created
relative to the current working directory as usual.

<p>Stand-alone scripts will often want to load additional modules from the
PicoLisp environment, beyond the "lib.l" we provided in the first line of the
hello-world script. Typically, at least a call to

<pre><code>
(load "@lib/misc.l")
</code></pre>

<p>(note the home directory substitution) will be included near the beginning of
the script.

<p>As a more complete example, here is a script which extracts the date, name
and size of the latest official PicoLisp release version from the download web
site, and prints it to standard output:

<pre><code>
#!/usr/bin/picolisp /usr/lib/picolisp/lib.l

(load "@lib/misc.l" "@lib/http.l")

(use (@Date @Name @Size)
   (when
      (match
         '(@Date " " "-" " " @Name " " "(" @Size ")")
         (client "software-lab.de" 80 "down.html"
            (from "Release Archive")
            (from ".tgz">")
            (till "") ) )
      (prinl @Name)
      (prinl @Date " -- " @Size) ) )

(bye)
</code></pre>

<h3>Editing scripts</h3>

<p>We recommend that you have a terminal window open, and try the examples by
yourself. You may either type them in, directly to the PicoLisp interpreter, or
edit a separate source file (e.g. <code>"doc/fun.l"</code>) in a second terminal
window and load it into PicoLisp with

<pre><code>
: (load "doc/fun.l")
</code></pre>

<p>each time you have modified and saved it.

<h3>Editing scripts with vi</h3>

<p>Once a function is loaded from a source file, you can call 'vim' directly on
that function with

<pre><code>
: (vi 'fact)
</code></pre>

<p>The function 'vi' opens the appropriate source file, and jumps to the right
line where 'fact' is defined. When you modify it, you can simply call 'ld' to
(re)load that source file

<pre><code>
: (ld)
</code></pre>

<h2><a name="oop">Objects and Classes</a></h2>

<p>The PicoLisp object model is very simple, yet flexible and powerful. Objects
as well as classes are both implemented as symbols. In fact, there is no formal
difference between objects and classes; classes are more a conceptual design
consideration in the head of the programmer than a physical reality.

<p>Having said this, we declare that normally:

<ol>
<li>A Class
   <ul>
   <li>Has a name (interned symbol)
   <li>Has method definitions and superclass(es) in the value cell
   <li>May have class variables (attributes) in the property list
   </ul>
<li>An Object
   <ul>
   <li>Has no name (anonymous symbol) or is an external symbol
   <li>Has class(es) (and optionally method definitions) in the value cell
   <li>Has instance variables (attributes) in the property list
   </ul>
</ol>

<p>So the main difference between classes and objects is that the former ones
usually are internal symbols. By convention, their names start with a
'<code>+</code>'. Sometimes it makes sense, however, to create named objects (as
global singletons, for example), or even anonymous classes.

<p>Both classes and objects have a list in their value cell, consisting of
method definitions (often empty for objects) and (super)class(es). And both
classes and objects have local data in their property lists (often empty for
classes). This implies, that any given object (as an instance of a class) may
have private (object-local) methods defined.

<p>It is rather difficult to contrive a simple OOP example. We constructed a
hierarchy of geometric shapes, with a base class <code>+Shape</code> and two
subclasses <code>+Rectangle</code> and <code>+Circle</code>.

<p>The source code is included as "<code><a
href="shape.l">doc/shape.l</a></code>" in the PicoLisp distribution, so you
don't have to type it in. Just <code><a href="refL.html#load">load</a></code>
the file, or start it from the shell as:

<pre><code>
$ ./dbg doc/shape.l
</code></pre>

<p>Let's look at it piece by piece. Here's the base class:

<pre><code>
(class +Shape)
# x y

(dm T (X Y)
   (=: x X)
   (=: y Y) )

(dm move> (DX DY)
   (inc (:: x) DX)
   (inc (:: y) DY) )
</code></pre>

<p>The first line '<code>(class +Shape)</code>' defines the symbol
<code>+Shape</code> as a class without superclasses. The following method
definitions will go to that class.

<p>The comment '<code># x y</code>' in the second line is just a convention, to
indicate what instance variables (properties) that class uses. As PicoLisp is a
dynamic language, a class can be extended at runtime with any number of
properties, and there is nothing like a fixed object size or structure. This
comment is a hint of what the programmer thinks to be essential and typical for
that class. In the case of <code>+Shape</code>, <code>x</code> and
<code>y</code> are the coordinates of the shape's origin.

<p>Then we have two method definitions, using the keyword <code><a
href="refD.html#dm">dm</a></code> for "define method". The first method is
special, in that its name is <code>T</code>. Each time a new object is created,
and a method with that name is found in its class hierarchy, that method will be
executed. Though this looks like a "constructor" in other programming languages,
it should probably better be called "initializer". The <code>T</code> method of
<code>+Shape</code> takes two arguments <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code>, and
stores them in the object's property list.

<p>The second method <code>move&gt;</code> changes the object's origin by adding
the offset values <code>DX</code> and <code>DY</code> to the object's origin.

<p>Now to the first derived class:

<pre><code>
(class +Rectangle +Shape)
# dx dy

(dm T (X Y DX DY)
   (super X Y)
   (=: dx DX)
   (=: dy DY) )

(dm area> ()
   (* (: dx) (: dy)) )

(dm perimeter> ()
   (* 2 (+ (: dx) (: dy))) )

(dm draw> ()
   (drawRect (: x) (: y) (: dx) (: dy)) )
</code></pre>

<p><code>+Rectangle</code> is defined as a subclass of <code>+Shape</code>.
The comment '<code># dx dy</code>' indicates that <code>+Rectangle</code> has a
width and a height in addition to the origin coordinates inherited from
<code>+Shape</code>.

<p>The <code>T</code> method passes the origin coordinates <code>X</code> and
<code>Y</code> to the <code>T</code> method of the superclass
(<code>+Shape</code>), then stores the width and height parameters into
<code>dx</code> and <code>dy</code>.

<p>Next we define the methods <code>area&gt;</code> and
<code>perimeter&gt;</code> which do some obvious calculations, and a method
<code>draw&gt;</code> which is supposed to draw the shape on the screen by
calling some hypothetical function <code>drawRect</code>.

<p>Finally, we define a <code>+Circle</code> class in an analog way, postulating
the hypothetical function <code>drawCircle</code>:

<pre><code>
(class +Circle +Shape)
# r

(dm T (X Y R)
   (super X Y)
   (=: r R) )

(dm area> ()
   (*/ (: r) (: r) 31415927 10000000) )

(dm perimeter> ()
   (*/ 2 (: r) 31415927 10000000) )

(dm draw> ()
   (drawCircle (: x) (: y) (: r)) )
</code></pre>

<p>Now we can experiment with geometrical shapes. We create a rectangle at point
(0,0) with a width of 30 and a height of 20, and keep it in the variable
<code>R</code>:

<pre><code>
: (setq R (new '(+Rectangle) 0 0 30 20))  # New rectangle
-> $134432824                             # returned anonymous symbol
: (show R)
$134432824 (+Rectangle)                   # Show the rectangle
   dy 20
   dx 30
   y 0
   x 0
</code></pre>

<p>We see that the symbol <code>$134432824</code> has a list of classes
'<code>(+Rectangle)</code>' in its value cell, and the coordinates, width and
height in is property list.

<p>Sending messages to that object

<pre><code>
: (area> R)                               # Calculate area
-> 600
: (perimeter> R)                          # and perimeter
-> 100
</code></pre>

<p>will return the values for area and perimeter, respectively.

<p>Then we move the object's origin:

<pre><code>
: (move> R 10 5)                          # Move 10 right and 5 down
-> 5
: (show R)
$134432824 (+Rectangle)
   y 5                                    # Origin changed (0,0) -> (10,5)
   x 10
   dy 20
   dx 30
</code></pre>

<p>Though a method <code>move&gt;</code> wasn't defined for the
<code>+Rectangle</code> class, it is inherited from the <code>+Shape</code>
superclass.

<p>Similarly, we create and use a circle object:

<pre><code>
: (setq C (new '(+Circle) 10 10 30))      # New circle
-> $134432607                             # returned anonymous symbol
: (show C)
$134432607 (+Circle)                      # Show the circle
   r 30
   y 10
   x 10
-> $134432607
: (area> C)                               # Calculate area
-> 2827
: (perimeter> C)                          # and perimeter
-> 188
: (move> C 10 5)                          # Move 10 right and 5 down
-> 15
: (show C)
$134432607 (+Circle)                      # Origin changed (10,10) -> (20,15)
   y 15
   x 20
   r 30
</code></pre>

<p>It is also easy to send messages to objects in a list:

<pre><code>
: (mapcar 'area> (list R C))              # Get list of areas
-> (600 2827)
: (mapc
   '((Shape) (move> Shape 10 10))         # Move all 10 right and down
   (list R C) )
-> 25
: (show R)
$134431493 (+Rectangle)
   y 15
   x 20
   dy 20
   dx 30
-> $134431493
: (show C)
$134431523 (+Circle)
   y 25
   x 30
   r 30
</code></pre>

<p>Assume that we want to extend our shape system. From time to time, we need
shapes that behave exactly like the ones above, but are tied to a fixed
position. That is, they do not change their position even if they receive a
<code>move&gt;</code> message.

<p>One solution would be to modify the <code>move&gt;</code> method in the
<code>+Shape</code> class to a no-operation. But this would require to duplicate
the whole shape hierarchy (e.g. by defining <code>+FixedShape</code>,
<code>+FixedRectangle</code> and <code>+FixedCircle</code> classes).

<p>The PicoLisp Way is the use of <u>Prefix Classes</u> through multiple
inheritance. It uses the fact that searching for method definitions is a
depth-first, left-to-right search of the class tree. We define a prefix class:

<pre><code>
: (class +Fixed)

(dm move> (DX DY))  # A do-nothing method
</code></pre>

<p>We can now create a fixed rectangle, and try to move it:

<pre><code>
: (setq R (new '(+Fixed +Rectangle) 0 0 30 20))    # '+Fixed' prefix class
-> $134432881
: (move> R 10 5)                                   # Send 'move>' message
-> NIL
: (show R)
$134432881 (+Fixed +Rectangle)
   dy 20
   dx 30
   y 0                                             # Did not move!
   x 0
</code></pre>

<p>We see, prefix classes can surgically change the inheritance tree for
selected objects or classes.

<p>Alternatively, if fixed rectangles are needed often, it might make sense to
define a new class <code>+FixRect</code>:

<pre><code>
: (class +FixRect +Fixed +Rectangle)
-> +FixRect
</code></pre>

<p>and then use it directly:

<pre><code>
: (setq R (new '(+FixRect) 0 0 30 20))
-> $13455710
</code></pre>


<p><hr>
<h2><a name="ext">Persistence (External Symbols)</a></h2>

<p>PicoLisp has persistent objects built-in as a first class data type. With
"first class" we mean not just the ability of being passed around, or returned
from functions (that's a matter of course), but that they are a primary data
type with their own interpreter tag bits. They are, in fact, a special type of
symbolic atoms (called "<a href="ref.html#external">External Symbols</a>"), that
happen to be read from pool file(s) when accessed, and written back
automatically when modified.

<p>In all other aspects they are normal symbols. They have a value cell, a
property list and a name.

<p>The name cannot be directly controlled by the programmer, as it is assigned
when the symbol is created. It is an encoded index of the symbol's location in
its database file. In its visual representation (output by the <code><a
href="refP.html#print">print</a></code> functions and input by the <code><a
href="refR.html#read">read</a></code> functions) it is surrounded by braces.

<p>To make use of external symbols, you need to open a database first:

<pre><code>
: (pool "test.db")
</code></pre>

<p>If a file with that name did not exist, it got created now. Also created at
the same moment was <code>{1}</code>, the very first symbol in the file. This
symbol is of great importance, and is handled especially by PicoLisp. Therefore
a global constant <code><a href="refD.html#*DB">*DB</a></code> exists, which
points to that symbol <code>{1}</code>, which should be used exclusively to
access the symbol <code>{1}</code>, and which should never be modified by the
programmer.

<pre><code>
: *DB                   # The value of '*DB'
-> {1}                  # is '{1}'
: (show *DB)
{1} NIL                 # Value of '{1}' is NIL, property list empty
</code></pre>

<p>Now let's put something into the value cell and property list of
<code>{1}</code>.

<pre><code>
: (set *DB "Hello world")  # Set value of '{1}' to a transient symbol (string)
-> "Hello world"
: (put *DB 'a 1)           # Property 'a' to 1
-> 1
: (put *DB 'b 2)           # Property 'b' to 2
-> 2
: (show *DB)               # Now show the symbol '{1}'
{1} "Hello world"
   b 2
   a 1
</code></pre>

<p>Note that instead of '<code>(set *DB "Hello world")</code>', we might
also have written '<code>(setq {1} "Hello world")</code>', and instead of
'<code>(put *DB 'a 1)</code>' we might have written '<code>(put '{1} 'a
1)</code>'. This would have the same effect, but as a rule external symbols
should never be be accessed literally in application programs, because the
garbage collector might not be able to free these symbols and all symbols
connected to them (and that might well be the whole database). It is all right,
however, to access external symbols literally during interactive debugging.

<p>Now we can create our first own external symbol. This can be done with
<code><a href="refN.html#new">new</a></code> when a <code>T</code> argument is
supplied:

<pre><code>
: (new T)
-> {2}               # Got a new symbol
</code></pre>

<p>We store it in the database root <code>{1}</code>:

<pre><code>
: (put *DB 'newSym '{2})   # Literal '{2}' (ok during debugging)
-> {2}
: (show *DB)
{1} "Hello world"
   newSym {2}              # '{2}' is now stored in '{1}'
   b 2
   a 1
</code></pre>

<p>Put some property value into '{2}'

<pre><code>
: (put *DB 'newSym 'x 777) # Put 777 as 'x'-property of '{2}'
-> 777
: (show *DB 'newSym)       # Show '{2}' (indirectly)
{2} NIL
   x 777
-> {2}
: (show '{2})              # Show '{2}' (directly)
{2} NIL
   x 777
</code></pre>

<p>All modifications to - and creations of - external symbols done so far are
not written to the database yet. We could call <code><a
href="refR.html#rollback">rollback</a></code> (or simply exit PicoLisp) to undo
all the changes. But as we want to keep them:

<pre><code>
: (commit)           # Commit all changes
-> T
: (bye)              # Exit picolisp
$                    # back to the shell
</code></pre>

<p>So, the next time when ..

<pre><code>
$ ./dbg                 # .. we start PicoLisp
: (pool "test.db")      # and open the database file,
-> T
: (show *DB)            # our two symbols are there again
{1} "Hello world"
   newSym {2}
   b 2
   a 1
-> {1}
: (show *DB 'newSym)
{2} NIL
   x 777
-> {2}
</code></pre>


<p><hr>
<h2><a name="db">Database Programming</a></h2>

<p>To a database, there is more than just persistence. PicoLisp includes an
entity/relation class framework (see also <a href="ref.html#dbase">Database</a>)
which allows a close mapping of the application data structure to the database.

<p>We provided a simple yet complete database and GUI demo application in
<code><a href="family.l">doc/family.l</a></code>. We recommend to start it up
for test purposes in the following way:

<pre><code>
$ ./dbg doc/family.l -main
:
</code></pre>

<p>This loads the source file, initializes the database by calling the
<code>main</code> function, and prompts for user input.

<p>The data model is small and simple. We define a class <code>+Person</code>
and two subclasses <code>+Man</code> and <code>+Woman</code>.

<pre><code>
(class +Person +Entity)
</code></pre>

<p><code>+Person</code> is a subclass of the <code><a
href="refE.html#+Entity">+Entity</a></code> system class. Usually all objects in
a database are of a direct or indirect subclass of <code><a
href="refE.html#+Entity">+Entity</a></code>. We can then define the relations to
other data with the <code><a href="refR.html#rel">rel</a></code> function.

<pre><code>
(rel nm (+Need +Sn +Idx +String))      # Name
</code></pre>

<p>This defines the name property (<code>nm</code>) of a person. The first
argument to <code>rel</code> is always a list of relation classes (subclasses of
<code><a href="refR.html#+relation">+relation</a></code>), optionally followed
by further arguments, causing relation daemon objects be created and stored in
the class definition. These daemon objects control the entity's behavior later
at runtime.

<p>Relation daemons are a kind of <i>metadata</i>, controlling the interactions
between entities, and maintaining database integrity. Like other classes,
relation classes can be extended and refined, and in combination with proper
prefix classes a fine-grained description of the application's structure can be
produced.

<p>Besides primitive relation classes, like <code>+Number</code>,
<code>+String</code> or <code>+Date</code>, there are

<ul>

<li>relations between entities, like <code>+Link</code> (unidirectional link),
<code>+Joint</code> (bidirectional link) or <code>+Hook</code> (object-local
index trees)

<li>relations that bundle other relations into a single unit (<code>+Bag</code>)

<li>a <code>+List</code> prefix class

<li>a <code>+Blob</code> class for "binary large objects"

<li>prefix classes that maintain index trees, like <code>+Key</code> (unique
index), <code>+Ref</code> (non-unique index) or <code>+Idx</code> (full text
index)

<li>prefix classes which in turn modify index class behavior, like
<code>+Sn</code> (modified soundex algorithm [<a href="#knuth73">knuth73</a>]
for tolerant searches)

<li>a <code>+Need</code> prefix class, for existence checks

<li>a <code>+Dep</code> prefix class controlling dependencies between other
relations

</ul>

<p>In the case of the person's name (<code>nm</code>) above, the relation object
is of type <code>(+Need +Sn +Idx +String)</code>. Thus, the name of each person
in this demo database is a mandatory attribute (<code>+Need</code>), searchable
with the soundex algorithm (<code>+Sn</code>) and a full index
(<code>+Idx</code>) of type <code>+String</code>.

<pre><code>
(rel pa (+Joint) kids (+Man))          # Father
(rel ma (+Joint) kids (+Woman))        # Mother
(rel mate (+Joint) mate (+Person))     # Partner
</code></pre>

<p>The attributes for <i>father</i> (<code>pa</code>), <i>Mother</i>
(<code>ma</code>) and <i>partner</i> (<code>mate</code>) are all defined as
<code>+Joint</code>s. A <code>+Joint</code> is probably the most powerful
relation mechanism in PicoLisp; it establishes a bidirectional link between two
objects.

<p>The above declarations say that the <i>father</i> (<code>pa</code>) attribute
points to an object of type <code>+Man</code>, and is joined with that object's
<code>kids</code> attribute (which is a list of joints back to all his
children).

<p>The consistency of <code>+Joint</code>s is maintained automatically by the
relation daemons. These become active whenever a value is stored to a person's
<code>pa</code>, <code>ma</code>, <code>mate</code> or <code>kids</code>
property.

<p>For example, interesting things happen when a person's <code>mate</code> is
changed to a new value. Then the <code>mate</code> property of the old mate's
object is cleared (she has no mate after that). Now when the person pointed to
by the new value already has a mate, then that mate's <code>mate</code> property
gets cleared, and the happy new two mates now get their joints both set
correctly.

<p>The programmer doesn't have to care about all that. He just declares these
relations as <code>+Joint</code>s.

<p>The last four attributes of person objects are just static data:

<pre><code>
(rel job (+Ref +String))               # Occupation
(rel dat (+Ref +Date))                 # Date of birth
(rel fin (+Ref +Date))                 # Date of death
(rel txt (+String))                    # Info
</code></pre>

<p>They are all searchable via a non-unique index (<code>+Ref</code>). Date
values in PicoLisp are just numbers, representing the numbers of days since
first of March in the year zero.

<p>A method <code>url&gt;</code> is defined:

<pre><code>
(dm url> ()
   (list "@person" '*ID This) )
</code></pre>

<p>It is needed later in the GUI, to cause a click on a link to switch to that
object.

<p>The classes <code>+Man</code> and <code>+Woman</code> are subclasses of
<code>+Person</code>:

<pre><code>
(class +Man +Person)
(rel kids (+List +Joint) pa (+Person)) # Children

(class +Woman +Person)
(rel kids (+List +Joint) ma (+Person)) # Children
</code></pre>

<p>They inherit everything from <code>+Person</code>, except for the
<code>kids</code> attribute. This attribute joins with the <code>pa</code> or
<code>ma</code> attribute of the child, depending on the parent's gender.

<p>That's the whole data model for our demo database application.

<p>It is followed by a call to <code><a href="refD.html#dbs">dbs</a></code>
("database sizes"). This call is optional. If it is not present, the whole
database will reside in a single file, with a block size of 256 bytes. If it is
given, it should specify a list of items, each having a number in its CAR, and a
list in its CDR. The CARs taken together will be passed later to <a
href="refP.html#pool">pool</a>, causing an individual database file with that
size to be created. The CDRs tell what entity classes (if an item is a symbol)
or index trees (if an item is a list with a class in its CAR and a list of
relations in its CDR) should be placed into that file.


<p>A handful of access functions is provided, that know about database
relationships and thus allows higher-level access modes to the external symbols
in a database.

<p>For one thing, the B-Trees created and maintained by the index daemons can be
used directly. Though this is rarely done in a typical application, they form
the base mechanisms of other access modes and should be understood first.

<p>The function <code><a href="refT.html#tree">tree</a></code> returns the tree
structure for a given relation. To iterate over the whole tree, the functions
<code><a href="refI.html#iter">iter</a></code> and <code><a
href="refS.html#scan">scan</a></code> can be used:

<pre><code>
(iter (tree 'dat '+Person) '((P) (println (datStr (get P 'dat)) (get P 'nm))))
"1770-08-03" "Friedrich Wilhelm III"
"1776-03-10" "Luise Augusta of Mecklenburg-Strelitz"
"1797-03-22" "Wilhelm I"
...
</code></pre>

<p>They take a function as the first argument. It will be applied to all objects
found in the tree (to show only a part of the tree, an optional begin- and
end-value can be supplied), producing a simple kind of report.

<p>More useful is <code><a href="refC.html#collect">collect</a></code>; it
returns a list of all objects that fall into a range of index values:

<pre><code>
: (collect 'dat '+Person (date 1982 1 1) (date 1988 12 31))
-> ({2-M} {2-L} {2-E})
</code></pre>

<p>This returns all persons born between 1982 and 1988. Let's look at them with
<code><a href="refS.html#show">show</a></code>:

<pre><code>
: (more (collect 'dat '+Person (date 1982 1 1) (date 1988 12 31)) show)
{2-M} (+Man)
   nm "William"
   dat 724023
   ma {2-K}
   pa {2-J}
   job "Heir to the throne"

{2-L} (+Man)
   nm "Henry"
   dat 724840
   ma {2-K}
   pa {2-J}
   job "Prince"

{2-E} (+Woman)
   nm "Beatrice"
   dat 726263
   ma {2-D}
   job "Princess"
   pa {2-B}
</code></pre>

<p>If you are only interested in a certain attribute, e.g. the name, you can
return it directly:

<pre><code>
: (collect 'dat '+Person (date 1982 1 1) (date 1988 12 31) 'nm)
-> ("William" "Henry" "Beatrice")
</code></pre>

<p>To find a single object in the database, the function <code><a
href="refD.html#db">db</a></code> is used:

<pre><code>
: (db 'nm '+Person "Edward")
-> {2-;}
</code></pre>

<p>If the key is not unique, additional arguments may be supplied:

<pre><code>
: (db 'nm '+Person "Edward"  'job "Prince"  'dat (date 1964 3 10))
-> {2-;}
</code></pre>

<p>The programmer must know which combination of keys will suffice to specify
the object uniquely. The tree search is performed using the first value
("Edward"), while all other attributes are used for filtering. Later, in
the <a href="#pilog">Pilog</a> section, we will show how more general (and
possibly more efficient) searches can be performed.

<h2><a name="gui">User Interface (GUI) Programming</a></h2>

<p>The only types of GUI supported by the PicoLisp application server framework
is either dynamically generated (but static by nature) HTML, or an interactive
XHTML/CSS framework with the optional use of JavaScript.

<p>Before we explain the GUI of our demo database application, we present a
minimal example for a plain HTML-GUI in <code><a
href="hello.l">doc/hello.l</a></code>. Start the application server as:

<pre><code>
$ ./p lib/http.l -'server 8080 "doc/hello.l"' -wait
</code></pre>

<p>Now point your browser to the address '<code><a
href="http://localhost:8080">http://localhost:8080</a></code>'. You should see a
very simple HTML page. You can come back here with the browser's BACK button.

<p>You can call the page repeatedly, or concurrently with many clients if you
like. To terminate the server, you have to send it a TERM signal (e.g.
'<code>killall picolisp</code>'), or type the <code>Ctrl-C</code> key in the
console window.

<p>In our demo database application, a single function <code>person</code> is
responsible for the whole GUI. Again, please look at <code><a
href="family.l">doc/family.l</a></code>.

<p>To start the database <i>and</i> the application server, call:

<pre><code>
$ ./dbg doc/family.l -main -go
</code></pre>

<p>As before, the database is opened with <code>main</code>. The function
<code>go</code> is also defined in <code>doc/family.l</code>:

<pre><code>
(de go ()
   (server 8080 "@person") )
</code></pre>

<p>It starts the HTTP server listening on TCP port 8080 (we did a similar thing
in our minimal GUI example above directly on the command line). Each connect to
that port will cause the function <code>person</code> to be invoked.

<p>Again, point your browser to the address '<code><a
href="http://localhost:8080" target="GUI">http://localhost:8080</a></code>'.

<p>You should see a new browser window with an input form created by the
function <code>person</code>. We provided an initial database in
"doc/family/[1-4]". You can navigate through it by clicking on the pencil icons
besides the input fields.

<p>The chart with the children data can be scrolled using the down
(<code>v</code>) and up (<code>^</code>) buttons.

<p>A click on the button "Select" below opens a search dialog. You can scroll
through the chart as before. Again, a click on a pencil will jump to that
person. You can abort the dialog with a click on the "Cancel"-button.

<p>The search fields in the upper part of the dialog allow a conjunctive search.
If you enter "Edward" in the "Name" field and click "Search", you'll see all
persons having the string "Edward" in their name. If you also enter "Duke" in
the "Occupation" field, the result list will reduce to only two entries.

<p>To create a new person, press the "New Man" or "New Woman" button. A new
empty form will be displayed. Please type a name into the first field, and
perhaps also an occupation and birth date. Any change of contents should be
followed by a press on the "Done" button, though any other button (also Scroll
or Select-buttons) will also do.

<p>To assign a <i>father</i> attribute, you can either type a name directly into
the field (if that person already exists in the database and you know the exact
spelling), or use the "Set"-button (<code>-&gt;</code>) to the left of that
field to open the search dialog. If you type in the name directly, your input
must exactly match upper and lower case.

<p>Alternatively, you may create a new person and assign a child in the
"Children" chart.

<p>On the console where you started PicoLisp, there should a prompt have
appeared just when the browser connected. You can debug the application
interactively while it is running. For example, the global variable
<code>*Top</code> always contains the top level GUI object:

<pre><code>
: (show *Top)
</code></pre>

<p>To take a look at the first field on the form:

<pre><code>
: (show *Top 'gui 1)
</code></pre>

<p>A production application would be started in a slightly different way:

<pre><code>
$ ./p doc/family.l -main -go -wait
</code></pre>

<p>In that case, no debug prompt will appear. In both cases, however, two
<code>picolisp</code> processes will be running now. One is the initial server
process which will continue to run until it is killed. The other is a child
process holding the state of the GUI in the browser. It will terminate some time
after the browser is closed, or when <code>(<a
href="refB.html#bye">bye</a>)</code> or a plain ENTER is entered at the PicoLisp
prompt.

<p>Now back to the explanation of the GUI function <code>person</code>:

<pre><code>
(de person ()
   (app)
   (action
      (html 0 (get (default *ID (seq (db: +Person))) 'nm) "lib.css" NIL
         (form NIL
            (&lt;h3&gt; (&lt;id&gt; (: nm)))
</code></pre>

<p>For an in-depth explanation of that startup code, please refer to the guide
to <a href="app.html">PicoLisp Application Development</a>.

<p>All components like fields and buttons are controlled by <code>form</code>.
The function <code>gui</code> creates a single GUI component and takes the type
(a list of classes) and a variable number of arguments depending on the needs of
these classes.

<pre><code>
   (gui '(+E/R +TextField) '(nm : home obj) 40 "Name")
</code></pre>

<p>This creates a <code>+TextField</code> with the label "Name" and a length of
40 characters. The <code>+E/R</code> (: Entity/Relation) prefix class connects
that field to a database object, the <code>nm</code> attribute of a person in
this case, so that the person's name is displayed in that text field, and any
changes entered into that field are propagated to the database automatically.

<pre><code>
   (gui '(+ClassField) '(: home obj) '(("Male" +Man) ("Female" +Woman)))
</code></pre>

<p>A <code>+ClassField</code> displays and changes the class of an object, in
this case the person's sex from <code>+Man</code> to <code>+Woman</code> and
vice versa.

<p>As you see, there is no place where explicit accesses to the database have to
be programmed, no <code>select</code> or <code>update</code>. This is all
encapsulated in the GUI components, mainly in the <code>+E/R</code> prefix
class. The above function <code>person</code> is fully functional as we present
it and allows creation, modification and deletion of person objects in the
database.

<p>The two buttons on the bottom right generate simple reports:

<p>The first one shows all contemporaries of the person that is currently
displayed, i.e. all persons who did not die before, or were not born after that
person. This is a typical PicoLisp report, in that in addition to the report's
HTML page, a temporary file may be generated, suitable for download (and import
into a spread sheet), and from which a PDF can be produced for print-out.

<p>In PicoLisp, there is not a real difference between a plain HTML-GUI and a
report. Again, the function <code>html</code> is used to generate the page.

<p>The second report is much simpler. It produces a recursive structure of the
family.

<p>In both reports, links to the person objects are created which allow easy
navigation through the database.

<h2><a name="pilog">Pilog -- PicoLisp Prolog</a></h2>

<p>This sections explains some cases of using Pilog in typical application
programming, in combination with persistent objects and databases. Please refer
to the <a href="ref.html#pilog">Pilog</a> section of the PicoLisp Reference for
the basic usage of Pilog.

<p>Again, we use our demo application <code><a
href="family.l">doc/family.l</a></code> that was introduced in the <a
href="#db">Database Programming</a> section.

<p>Normally, Pilog is used either interactively to query the database during
debugging, or in applications to generate export data and reports. In the
following examples we use the interactive query front-end functions <code><a
href="ref_.html#?">?</a></code> and <code><a
href="refS.html#select">select</a></code>. An application will use <code><a
href="refG.html#goal">goal</a></code> and <code><a
href="refP.html#prove">prove</a></code> directly, or use convenience functions
like <code><a href="refP.html#pilog">pilog</a></code> or <code><a
href="refS.html#solve">solve</a></code>.

<p>All Pilog access to external symbols is done via the two predicates <code><a
href="refD.html#db/3">db/3</a></code> and <code><a
href="refS.html#select/3">select/3</a></code>.

<ul>

<li><code><a href="refD.html#db/3">db/3</a></code> corresponds to the Lisp-level
functions <code><a href="refD.html#db">db</a></code> and <code><a
href="refC.html#collect">collect</a></code>, as it derives its data from a
single relation. It can be used for simple database queries.

<li><code><a href="refS.html#select/3">select/3</a></code> provides for
self-optimizing parallel access to an arbitrary number of relations. There is
also a Lisp front-end function <code><a
href="refS.html#select">select</a></code>, for convenient calls to the Pilog
<code>select</code> predicate.

</ul>

<p>A predicate <code><a href="refS.html#show/1">show/1</a></code> is pre-defined
for debugging purposes (a simple glue to the Lisp-level function
<code>show</code>, see <a href="#brw">Browsing</a>). Searching with <code><a
href="refD.html#db/3">db/3</a></code> for all persons having the string "Edward"
in their name:

<pre><code>
: (? (db nm +Person "Edward" @P) (show @P))
{2-;} (+Man)
   nm "Edward"
   ma {2-:}
   pa {2-A}
   dat 717346
   job "Prince"
 @P={2-;}
{2-1B} (+Man)
   nm "Albert Edward"
   kids ({2-1C} {2-1D} {2-1E} {2-1F} {2-1G} {2-1H} {2-1I} {2-g} {2-a})
   job "Prince"
   mate {2-f}
   fin 680370
   dat 664554
 @P={2-1B}
...               # more results
</code></pre>

<p>To search for all persons with "Edward" in their name who are married to
somebody with occupation "Queen":

<pre><code>
: (? (db nm +Person "Edward" @P) (val "Queen" @P mate job) (show @P))
{2-1B} (+Man)
   mate {2-f}
   nm "Albert Edward"
   kids ({2-1C} {2-1D} {2-1E} {2-1F} {2-1G} {2-1H} {2-1I} {2-g} {2-a})
   job "Prince"
   fin 680370
   dat 664554
 @P={2-1B}
-> NIL            # only one result
</code></pre>

<p>If you are interested in the names of "Albert Edward"'s children:

<pre><code>
: (? (db nm +Person "Albert Edward" @P) (lst @K @P kids) (val @Kid @K nm))
 @P={2-1B} @K={2-1C} @Kid="Beatrice Mary Victoria"
 @P={2-1B} @K={2-1D} @Kid="Leopold George Duncan"
 @P={2-1B} @K={2-1E} @Kid="Arthur William Patrick"
 @P={2-1B} @K={2-1F} @Kid="Louise Caroline Alberta"
 @P={2-1B} @K={2-1G} @Kid="Helena Augusta Victoria"
 @P={2-1B} @K={2-1H} @Kid="Alfred Ernest Albert"
 @P={2-1B} @K={2-1I} @Kid="Alice Maud Mary"
 @P={2-1B} @K={2-g} @Kid="Victoria Adelaide Mary"
 @P={2-1B} @K={2-a} @Kid="Edward VII"
-> NIL
</code></pre>

<p><code><a href="refD.html#db/3">db/3</a></code> can do a direct index access
only for a single attribute (<code>nm</code> of <code>+Person</code> above). To
search for several criteria at the same time, <code><a
href="refS.html#select/3">select/3</a></code> has to be used:

<pre><code>
: (?
   (select (@P)
      ((nm +Person "Edward") (nm +Person "Augusta" pa))  # Generator clauses
      (tolr "Edward" @P nm)                              # Filter clauses
      (tolr "Augusta" @P kids nm) )
   (show @P) )
{2-1B} (+Man)
   kids ({2-1C} {2-1D} {2-1E} {2-1F} {2-1G} {2-1H} {2-1I} {2-g} {2-a})
   mate {2-f}
   nm "Albert Edward"
   job "Prince"
   fin 680370
   dat 664554
 @P={2-1B}
-> NIL
</code></pre>

<p><code><a href="refS.html#select/3">select/3</a></code> takes a list of
generator clauses which are used to retrieve objects from the database, and a
number of normal Pilog filter clauses. In the example above the generators are

<ul>

<li><code>(nm +Person "Edward")</code> to generate persons with "Edward" in
their names, and

<li><code>(nm +Person "Augusta" pa)</code> to find persons with "Augusta"
in their names and generate persons using the <code>pa</code> ("father")
attribute.

</ul>

<p>All persons generated are possible candidates for our selection. The
<code>nm</code> index tree of <code>+Person</code> is traversed twice in
parallel, optimizing the search in such a way that successful hits get higher
priority in the search, depending on the filter clauses. The process will stop
as soon as any one of the generators is exhausted. Note that this is different
from the standard Prolog search algorithm.

<p>The filter clauses in this example both use the pre-defined predicate
<code><a href="refT.html#tolr/3">tolr/3</a></code> for <i>tolerant</i> string
matches (according either to the soundex algorithm (see the section <a
href="#db">Database Programming</a>) or to substring matches), and filter
objects that

<ul>

<li>match "Edward" in their name: <code>(tolr "Edward" @P nm)</code>, and

<li>match "Augusta" in one of their kids' names: <code>(tolr "Augusta" @P
kids nm)</code>

</ul>

<p>A more typical and extensive example for the usage of <code>select</code> can
be found in the <code>qPerson</code> function in <code><a
href="family.l">doc/family.l</a></code>. It is used in the search dialog of the
demo application, and searches for a person with the name, the parents' and
partner's names, the occupation and a time range for the birth date. The
relevant index trees in the database are searched (actually only those trees
where the user entered a search key in the corresponding dialog field), and a
logical AND of the search attributes is applied to the result.

<p>For example, press the "Select" button, enter "Elizabeth" into the "Mother"
search field and "Phil" in the "Partner" search field, meaning to look for all
persons whose mother's name is like "Elizabeth" and whose partner's name is like
"Phil". As a result, two persons ("Elizabeth II" and "Anne") will show up.

<p>In principle, <code><a href="refD.html#db/3">db/3</a></code> can be seen as a
special case of <code><a href="refS.html#select/3">select/3</a></code>. The
following two queries are equivalent:

<pre><code>
: (? (db nm +Person "Edward" @P))
 @P={2-;}
 @P={2-1B}
 @P={2-R}
 @P={2-1K}
 @P={2-a}
 @P={2-T}
-> NIL
: (? (select (@P) ((nm +Person "Edward"))))
 @P={2-;}
 @P={2-1B}
 @P={2-R}
 @P={2-1K}
 @P={2-a}
 @P={2-T}
-> NIL
</code></pre>

<h2><a name="sql">Poor Man's SQL</a></h2>

<h3>select</h3>

<p>For convenience, a <code><a href="refS.html#select">select</a></code> Lisp
glue function is provided as a front-end to the <code>select</code> predicate.
Note that this function does not evaluate its arguments (it is intended for
interactive use), and that it supports only a subset of the predicate's
functionality. The syntax resembles SELECT in the SQL language, for example:

<pre><code>
# SELECT * FROM Person
: (select +Person)  # Step through the whole database
{2-o} (+Man)
   nm "Adalbert Ferdinand Berengar Viktor of Prussia"
   dat 688253
   ma {2-j}
   pa {2-h}
   fin 711698

{2-1B} (+Man)
   nm "Albert Edward"
   dat 664554
   job "Prince"
   mate {2-f}
   kids ({2-1C} {2-1D} {2-1E} {2-1F} {2-1G} {2-1H} {2-1I} {2-g} {2-a})
   fin 680370
...
</code></pre>

<pre><code>
# SELECT * FROM Person WHERE nm LIKE "%Edward%"
: (select +Person nm "Edward")  # Show all Edwards
{2-;} (+Man)
   nm "Edward"
   dat 717346
   job "Prince"
   ma {2-:}
   pa {2-A}

{2-1B} (+Man)
   nm "Albert Edward"
   dat 664554
   job "Prince"
   kids ({2-1C} {2-1D} {2-1E} {2-1F} {2-1G} {2-1H} {2-1I} {2-g} {2-a})
   mate {2-f}
   fin 680370
...
</code></pre>

<pre><code>
# SELECT nm, dat FROM Person WHERE nm LIKE "%Edward%"
: (select nm dat +Person nm "Edward")
"Edward" "1964-03-10" {2-;}
"Albert Edward" "1819-08-26" {2-1B}
"George Edward" NIL {2-R}
"Edward Augustus Hanover" NIL {2-1K}
...
</code></pre>

<pre><code>
# SELECT dat, fin, p1.nm, p2.nm
#    FROM Person p1, Person p2
#    WHERE p1.nm LIKE "%Edward%"
#    AND p1.job LIKE "King%"
#    AND p1.mate = p2.mate  -- Actually, in a SQL model we'd need
#                           -- another table here for the join
: (select dat fin nm (mate nm) +Person nm "Edward" job "King")
"1894-06-23" "1972-05-28" "Edward VIII" "Wallace Simpson" {2-T}
"1841-11-09" NIL "Edward VII" "Alexandra of Denmark" {2-a}
-> NIL
</code></pre>


<h3>update</h3>

<p>In addition (just to stay with the SQL terminology ;-), there is also an
<code><a href="refU.html#update">update</a></code> function. It is a front-end
to the <code><a href="refE.html#entityMesssages">set!></a></code> and <code><a
href="refE.html#entityMesssages">put!></a></code> transaction methods, and
should be used when single objects in the database have to be modified by hand.

<p>In principle, it would also be possible to use the <code><a
href="refE.html#edit">edit</a></code> function to modify a database object. This
is not recommended, however, because <code>edit</code> does not know about
relations to other objects (like Links, Joints and index trees) and may easily
cause database corruption.

<p>In the most general case, the value of a property in a database object is
changed with the <code>put!></code> method. Let's look at "Edward" from the
previous examples:

<pre><code>
: (show '{2-;})
{2R} (+Man)
   job "Prince"
   nm "Edward"
   dat 717346
   ma {2-:}
   pa {20A}
-> {2-;}
</code></pre>

<p>We might change the name to "Johnny" with <code>put!></code>:

<pre><code>
: (put!> '{2-;} 'nm "Johnny")
-> "Johnny"
</code></pre>

<p>However, an easier and less error-prone prone way - especially when more than
one property has to be changed - is using <code><a
href="refU.html#update">update</a></code>. It presents the value cell (the list
of classes) and then each property on its own line, allowing the user to change
it with the <a href="#ledit">command line editor</a>.

<p>Just hitting ENTER will leave that property unchanged. To modify it, you'll
typically hit ESC to get into command mode, and move the cursor to the point of
change.

<p>For properties with nested list structures (<code>+List +Bag</code>),
<code>update</code> will recurse into the data structure.

<pre><code>
: (update '{2-;})
{2-;} (+Man)      # ENTER
nm "Johnny"       # Modified the name to "Johnny"
ma {2-:}          # ENTER
pa {2-A}          # ENTER
dat 1960-03-10    # Modified the year from "1964" to "1960"
job "Prince"      # ENTER
-> {2-;}
</code></pre>

<p>All changes are committed immediately, observing the rules of database
synchronization so that any another user looking at the same object will have
his GUI updated correctly.

<p>To abort <code>update</code>, hit <code>Ctrl-X</code>.

<p>If only a single property has to be changed, <code>update</code> can be
called directly for that property:

<pre><code>
: (update '{2-;} 'nm)
{2-;} nm "Edward"
...
</code></pre>
