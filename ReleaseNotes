         Release Notes for picoLisp-3.0.5
         ================================

A. The 'pid' function was removed. This was announced in the previous version,
   and in the mailing list in

      http://www.mail-archive.com/picolisp@software-lab.de/msg01949.html

B. "Ersatz PicoLisp" (written in Java) was included for a first evaluation. For
   further informations, please look at "ersatz/README".

C. The pre-generated "*.s" files for the 64-bit version are no longer part of
   the release. They are rather large, and would multiply when further
   architectures and operating systems are supported. Instead, they may
   initially be generated with Ersatz PicoLisp, or downloaded from
   "http://software-lab.de/x86-64.linux.tgz".

D. The 'easter' function in "lib/cal.l" is no longer restricted to the years
   1900 through 2099.
